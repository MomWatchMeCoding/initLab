2. What is Init Lab all about? What events do you typically organize? What kinds of guests come? How do you all spend your time together? 

init Lab is all about sharing and learning new and improving existing skills in an environment suitable for techies.
We organize events, workshops, hackathons and meetings on programming, system administration, game development, personal development, music (we even have our own recording studio).
Our typical guests are developers, system administrators, designers, hardware engineers, support specialists, QAs - basically the full spectrum of tech-oriented people. At the events we organize on broader subjects you can find all kinds of people - marketing, advertising, artists, copywriters and many more. 
We spend our time together eating, sharing our work experience and looking for feedback and guidance, playing computer and board games, improving init Lab's infrastructure, working on organizing events and conferences. 

3. Is English spoken there? Do foreigners visit? Any feedback from them? 

Everyone speaks English and we always try to use it when there are foreigners around. Foreigners do visit, we even have members that are not Bulgarian. We have had many visitors come from various hackerspaces in Europe and with their help we managed to make the place more friendly by adding English labels where they were needed. We are also working on translating our website and wiki in English. 
4. Can you provide contacts of a foreign person who has been to the studio and has enjoyed his/her stay there or is about to visit?

Most people who come to init Lab take their privacy seriously and so do we. This is a hackerspace and we don't give information on who visits it to anyone.

5. What do guests pay for?

Guests pay for hot and cold beverages and food that is available on a self-service basis in our kitchen. init Lab is generally free to visit when it is open and we encourage guests to give donations of their own choosing if they fell like contributing to our cause.  

6. Can you describe the typical atmosphere at Init Lab?

It depends heavily on where and when, we have separate rooms with different functions, but in general keyboards and mouses clicking, people discussing, working together and laughing, casual music playing.
